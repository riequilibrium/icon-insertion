# Icon Insertion

This plugin inserts a set of icons inside of a product, visible in the Admin area, taking them automatically from a specific directory, so if you want to add new icons, just add them in that directory.  
Just click on the icon and it will be automatically added on top of the short description.

No need to set anything!
